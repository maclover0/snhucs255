# DriverPass CS255
This was an assignment for school.


DriverPass was a program designed to give online and in person training and testing advantages to pass the drivers test first attempt. The client wanted to have access to this wherever and there were 4 main actors (Admins/IT, Staff, Instructor, and Student).

I would like to revize how complicated I made the scheduling component of this because I think it could be simplified to show the same components to all of the actors. 

I interpreted the needs of the user by reading over some scripts of an interview and making assumptions in some cases. 

Hopefully in the future I will be able to actually talk to the people I design software for as that will greatly increase my chances of making a better product rather that relying on interviews. My main approach here though was to try and see what the users intent was in the end and create the product based on that from the information I had available.
